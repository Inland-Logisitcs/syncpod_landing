## Overview

This project is a Next.js application for a delivery company. It will feature a modern, responsive landing page to attract customers and showcase the company's services.

## Initial Design and Features

*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **Styling:** CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS (to be added)
*   **Deployment:** Vercel

## Current Task: Create a Landing Page

### Plan

1.  **Hero Section:**
    *   Create a compelling hero section with a background image, a strong headline, a brief description, and a primary call-to-action button.
2.  **Services Section:**
    *   Design a section to showcase the key services offered by the delivery company, such as "Fast Delivery," "Secure Packaging," and "24/7 Support." Use icons for visual representation.
3.  **"How It Works" Section:**
    *   Create a step-by-step guide on how to use the delivery service. For example: "1. Place an Order," "2. We Pick It Up," "3. We Deliver."
4.  **Testimonials Section:**
    *   Add a section for customer testimonials to build trust and credibility.
5.  **Footer:**
    *   A comprehensive footer with links to important pages, social media icons, and contact information.

### Style and Design

*   **Color Palette:** A modern and energetic color palette. Primary color for calls-to-action, with a mix of neutral and accent colors for the rest of the layout.
*   **Typography:** Clean and readable fonts. A combination of a sans-serif font for body text and a more distinct font for headlines.
*   **Iconography:** Use modern, minimalist icons to illustrate services and features.
*   **Imagery:** Use high-quality, relevant images. Placeholder images will be used initially.
*   **Layout:** A responsive, mobile-first layout using a grid system.
